![Me](/img/me2.jpg)

Trinidad & Tobago is my motherland, but Vancouver, Canada is the place I've called home since Jan 2017. Currently, I'm building the future with [Axiom Zen](https://www.axiomzen.co/) and bringing the island vibes to the kitty den with [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/).
