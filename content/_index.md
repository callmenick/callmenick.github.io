![Me](/img/me2.jpg)

Trinidad & Tobago is my motherland, but Vancouver, Canada is the place I've called home since Jan 2017. Currently, I'm building the future of blockchain with [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), and I'm the resident Lion Cat at [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/).
